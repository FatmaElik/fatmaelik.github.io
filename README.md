## Background
I earned my Bachelor's in Geophysical Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, laying the foundation for my academic journey. Subsequently, I pursued an **MSc in Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing**, also at **Istanbul Technical University**, where I specialized in utilizing satellite imagery for various applications. Transitioning to computer vision and deep learning skills, I applied my expertise in satellite imagery to develop innovative solutions. My research focused on earthquake damage detection, conducted for my thesis with the support of a **TUBITAK 2210/D scholarship** in collaboration with ESRI Turkey. This experience  advanced my technical skills and heightened my appreciation for technology's vital role in disaster detection.

The objective of my master's thesis, titled **Earthquake Damage Detection with Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning Approaches: A Case Study of the February 2023 Kahramanmaraş, Türkiye Earthquake Sequence**, was to investigate the potential of various deep learning techniques in recognizing structurally compromised buildings post-earthquake. Integrating remote sensing, computer vision, and earth observation within the realm of geophysics, this research aimed to underscore the importance of rapid intervention in critical situations.
